I would recommend it to IT / CS students who want to expand their knowledge more on developing websites using javascript. Not only technical stuff is taught here but also teaches you on how valuable your time is. This bootcamp teaches  you the right skills you need to acquire and learn on to land a job in the IT industry. Joining the DevLift Community helped me find my purpose in life. The journey will be hard I tell you but it is worth it. "
